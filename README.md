## **Overview**
Approximately 430 million people globally experience hearing impairments, leading to significant barriers in communication, both socially and professionally. While sign language serves as a critical medium for interaction, its limited understanding among the general public poses challenges for sign language users.

*SilenTalk* is an innovative real-time translation system that bridges this communication gap. By converting sign language gestures into text and audio, it fosters inclusivity and enables seamless interactions between sign language users and non-users.
